# Grocery List App

## by Daria Aleshina

### About the Project

The app is built using Vanilla JavaScript, with HTML and CSS adapted (with minor modifications) from the setup files provided in the project tutorial. The original tutorial can be found here: [Project Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=22703s).

### Potential Improvements

Below are areas identified for future improvement:

**Add Unit Tests**
Incorporate unit tests to ensure better maintainability.

**Refine the displayAlert Function**
The displayAlert function exhibits odd behavior when multiple error alerts are triggered before the previous one finishes executing.

**Fix the 'Edit' View**
Address the issue of extra white space appearing in the input form when an item title is displayed for editing.

**Enhance LocalStorage Implementation**
Save user input to localStorage with all words capitalized for better formatting consistency.
