# Grocery List App

## by Daria Aleshina

### About the Project

The app is built using Vanilla JavaScript, with HTML and CSS adapted (with minor modifications) from the setup files provided in the [Project Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=22703s).

### Potential Improvements

Below are areas identified for future improvement:

**Add Unit Tests.**
Incorporate unit tests to ensure better maintainability.

**Refine the displayAlert Function.**
The displayAlert function exhibits odd behavior when multiple error alerts are triggered before the previous one finishes executing.

**Refactor code adding Classes**
Introduce private methods and fields to encapsulate internal logic and restrict direct access to them.
